        "policy_welcome": "Hi there!!! \\\r\\\nWe are Made of Sundays and our goal is to bring a little magic into your home with our lovely fabric stickers and wall decals. Our stickers are the perfect solution to liven up the kids room or any other space where you need a daily dose of wall happiness. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nWhen you order a Made of Sundays product, you should know that it has been carefully designed by us in Finland before being printed and cut using the best quality materials and then packed & delivered to you with love from beautiful Helsinki.  \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nMADE OF WHAT? \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nWhenever possible we choose sustainable materials and make sure that our products have very little environmental impact. Our fabric stickers for example, are environmentally safe, bio-degradable and unicorn friendly. They are PVC free which is great for the environment and your health. Our vinyl decals are REACH-certified (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) by the European Comission, and are lead-free.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIn addition to that, the inks used for the printing do not have toxic solvents nor release dangerous chemicals. We only use recycled cardboard for packaging and we do our best remembering to turn off the tap while brushing our teeth.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nSTICK & REMOVE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nOur stickers and wall decals can be applied to any non-porous smooth surface including walls, windows, doors, laptops & furniture. They can be easily removed without leaving any residue nor damaging your walls. ",

        "policy_shipping": "All our decals are made to order in our tiny studio in Helsinki; we try to be as quick as the lightning when it comes to making your order, however sometimes it may take up to 2-5 days for us to make your decal, depending on the amount of orders we have on that date. That being said, let us know if you happen to be in a hurry and we will do our best to have the decal ready as soon as possible. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nWe ship WORLDWIDE and our orders are dispatched with Priority Shipping to make sure they arrive quickly to your home. Please allow 3-8 working days for orders within Europe and 4-10 working days for major cities outside Europe.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nUnfortunately, I have no control over the mysterious disappearance of packages...or the time it takes for the Post office to deliver any order. However, let me know if your order is taking too long to arrive; I will be more than happy to replace orders that have not arrived in 4 weeks for Europe or 6 weeks for the rest of the world. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nKeep in mind that if your country is not part of EU, your order may be subject to import duties, custom tariffs or VAT charges. In addition, some orders may experience customs delays. Unfortunately, we have no control over these charges or delays and cannot predict what they may be. We suggest that you contact your local customs office for additional information. ",

Be patient and don&#39;t panic as international shipment may take as little as one week or as much as three months on rare occasions from the shipment date which can be found of your CSERA purchase invoice. Delays are to be expected during higher-volume mailing periods, such as the pre\\/post Christmas shopping, Easter season etc. Some countries customs clearance offices run extra checks at peak times, this could be due to high security alerts, threats, or additional training. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nExtreme weather conditions like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and snow may effect delivery times. Public holidays and postal strikes can cause delays in packages being delivered. To check postal service public holidays, visit their website or local office to obtain information. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nFAILED DELIVERY\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nPostal workers can delivery to neighbors&#39; addresses or a family member may have accepted the delivery and not told you, the note left by the courier may have been misplaced so ensure you have checked your house\\/garage\\/porch\\/garden and spoken to neighbors\\/family before emailing us.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCouriers will not wish to damage your CSERA package by forcing it into a full mailbox. They may leave a note stating that they tried to deliver. Some mailboxes are too small to fit CSERA packages so they will need to be left with a neighbor, taken from the courier directly or collected from their facility.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf the courier service fails to notify you of an attempted delivery because they do not have your telephone number or the address could not be found etc, the package is stored in their facilities for 7 days and can be collected.  If it is not collected, the package will be destroyed and we cannot refund you so please check for courier notices and missed phone calls. Cases By Csera does not issue refunds for unclaimed packages\\/failed deliveries.  If you didn&#39;t receive your order because you failed to arrange collection, a refund will not be granted.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCustomers are responsible for making arrangements to receive CSERA products. If your package is held at the post office or delivery depot customers are responsible for collecting the goods promptly. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCSERA cannot provide information about specific postal service systems or regulations however, if you haven&#39;t received your Cases By Csera order by the 60 calendar days we will provide proof of shipment from our postal service for you to contact your postal service for investigation.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nAny resulting inconvenience from your postal service\\/customs office is to be dealt with them directly.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nWe offer boutique gift wrapping service at no extra charge so email us at checkout if you are gift giving.

Return shipping costs cannot be refunded if this was not an error in our manufacturing process\\/your order. We will pay the cost of shipping the new order\\/exchanged item.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n&#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t hear from you when I placed my order. Did you receive it?\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nWhen Cases By Csera receives an order, no contact is made unless there is an issue (i.e., out of stock, need clarification of order ie materials, model and color. Please don&#39;t panic if you don&#39;t hear from us, your order will be processed and shipped in the order it was received, CSERA are never late with shipments nor have we ever missed an order. Please check your email spam folders in case we have tried to contact you or your Etsy Invoice Email and shipping notification information is inside it.\\\r\\\n&#39;&#39;If I drop my iPhone, will the case protect it? Do you guarantee my phone won&#39;t be damaged?&#39;&#39;\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCSERA cases are economy, affordable, slim profile vanity type cases, this means they in no way protect the screen of your phone or from drop protection. If you are looking for a more protective case you may want to purchase a Otterbox style case. Please be aware of this before ordering, CSERA have sold thousands of cases to thousands of happy customers without issues. If you do need a protective drop type case we often suggest a commercial product like the Otterbox and not a designer\\/vanity case such as ours.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n&#39;&#39;What is a &#39;vanity case?&#39;\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nVanity cases are designed for fashion purposes and offer light protection for mobile devices. The price you pay is for the professionally designed artwork, the time it takes for me to make the case and packaging. CSERA cases are all limited edition and cannot be purchased elsewhere, meaning the artwork is completely unique and copyright protected.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nThe majority of the price you pay is for the limited edition artwork and materials that are made ethically in healthy working conditions for an average salary. \\\r\\\nWhile CSERA cases provide some light protection, any time an hard plastic case is dropped there is risk of damage to the case and\\/or your phone no matter which brand or price you pay. Cases By Csera are not liable for any damages arising from the use of our product.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCustomers are responsible for taking care of the CSERA cases, if the case is damaged by over excessive usage example; dropping the iPhone and case, rough handling whilst putting\\/taking the case on\\/off, washing the case with chemicals, over-exposure to UV rays (eg sun-light) exposure to sharp objects (eg keys, coins, nail file, zips etc) refunds and exchanges will not be available.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCSERA cases do not cause any loss of WIFI signal. If you have any issues with loss of signal, this maybe due to low-signal areas (internally and externally) and router\\/internet provider issues.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n&#39;&#39;How protective are your cases then?&#39;&#39;\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCSERA cases are vanity cases and if dropped they will crack just like most plastic cases on the market. This is not a manufacturing fault and we do not offer refunds or exchanges if customers drop their phones and the cases crack. \\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n&#39;&#39;The colors or design is different to the picture on the listing&#39;&#39;\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nAt Cases By Csera we try our best to ensure that all artwork matches your expectations and work very hard to accurately represent our product through photographs and descriptions. Some case designs may have variations to the image advertised due to lighting, angle of photography, screen resolution, manufacturing process and your screen\\/browser or mobile app settings and other factors such as artistic design and manual layout of the graphics. CSERA case colors match exactly what is on *our* computer screen and this could be very different to what your screen shows.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nA lot of people don&#39;t realize that the color of the image and\\/or product can vary widely from one computer monitor to another and even from person to person physically. What looks lavender on one computer can be gray on another computer and the same when you may see green but a friend see’s brown. If you are unable to determine the shade or exact color through the listing description, please send us for color confirmation.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nPlease note that colors and image pixel quality frequently appear different in real life than they appear on screen also due to the way different computer monitors are calibrated. Each CSERA item is made to order and variations in each product are part of the individuality of your chosen case.  Refund requests due to color\\/picture quality\\/graphic positioning\\/broken case\\/ will not be offered.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n",
